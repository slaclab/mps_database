class Condition(Base):

  Condition class (conditions table)

  Describe a condition that is composed of current values of one or more 
  digital and/or analog device faults (via FaultStates). Each fault input 
  is represented by a bit (starting at zero). When the combined state of
  the input faults match the condition value it becomes valid.

  A condition is used to ignore one ore more faults (digital and/or analog)

  Properties:
    name: condition identifier
    description: short description 
    value: bit mask used to verify if condition is met or not. 

  Relationships:
    ignore_conditions: list of fault states that compose this condition
    condition_inputs: list of fault states that are ignored when condition is true
