  DeviceType class (device_types table)

  Describe a class of devices, e.g. insertion device.

  Properties:
    name: base name for the PVs associated to this device
    description: 
    num_integrators: number of integrators for the device. This is applicable
                     to analog devices only, e.g. BPMs have 3 (X, Y and TMIT),
                     while other types may have from 1 up to 4.

  Relationships:
    states: referanced by DeviceState, tells in which states this
            DeviceType can be (e.g. In/Out/Moving/Broken)
    devices: list of DigitalDevices that are of this DeviceType
