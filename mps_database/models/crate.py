  Crate class (crates table)
  
  Describes an ATCA crate, properties are:
    crate_id: number that identifies the crate connected to a CPU. The CPU is
              the hostname where the link_node_id runs. There maybe one or
              more crates connected to one CPU (additional information at:
              https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/ppareg/EED+ATCA+Shelf+manager%27s+shelfaddress+naming+convention
              The crate_id is globally unique, it is unique among the crates
              connected to one CPU.
    shelf_number: 
    num_slots: number of slots available (usually 2 or 7)
    location: string containing area where this crate is installed (e.g. LKG02, LKA01)
    sector: string containing sector where this crate is installed (e.g. LI00, LI10, LTU, BSY)
    rack: string containing the rack identifier (usually a number)
    elevation: elevation within the rack

  Relationships:
    cards: each ApplicationCard has a reference to a crate 

  References:
    link_node_id: points to the link node (in slot 2) for this crate. There may be more
                  link nodes connected to other cards in the same crate (non-slot 2)
