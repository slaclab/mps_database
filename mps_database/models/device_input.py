class DeviceInput(Base):
  """
  DeviceInput class (device_input table)

  Properties:
   bit_position: specifies which bit this input should be used when
                 calculating the DigitalDevice value/state
   fault_value: defines which value (one or zero) means that the device
                is faulted. When a new value is received and is the same
                as fault_value it gets latched.
    auto_reset: defines whether the faulted device input value should be
                cleared once a good value is received. The auto-reset does
                not work if the input is used by a device with fast evaluation.
                Default value is False - i.e. a faulted input is held until
                it is reset by operators.
