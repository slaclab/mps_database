  BeamClass class (beam_classes table)

  Describe all available beam classes.

  Properties:
    number: beam class identifier, starting at 1 for the beam with least
            power and increasing according to the power. This number is
            used to define which BeamClass to use in case of a fault.

    description: short explanation for this beam class
    integration_window: time window used by MPS to verify beam power

    total_charge: maximum charge within the integration window

  Relationships:
    allowed_classes: list of AllowedClasses that have this BeamClass
