class ConditionInput(Base):
  """
  ConditionInput class (condition_inputs table)

  Defines one input for a Condition. If the ConditionInput is true, then
  the Condition evaluation value at the specified bit_position is set.

  The input is given by the FaultState referenced by fault_state_id. The
  FaultState defines which DeviceState causes a Fault to be true. The Fault
  has indirect references (via FaultInput/Device) to a device (e.g. YAG01B or
  OTRDMP), so a ConditionInput refers to faults generated by specific devices.

  Properties:
    bit_position: the position for the fault state within the condition value

  References:
    fault_state_id: reference to the fault_state, which if true makes this 
                    condition also true.
