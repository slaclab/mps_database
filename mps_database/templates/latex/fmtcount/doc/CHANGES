fmtcount package versions:

Version 1.3:

 * no longer loads xspace package (was causing extraneous
   spaces when the optional argument to \ordinalstring etc 
   was omitted.)
 * Made some long commands short.
 * Changes licence text in fmtcount.ins to conform with LPPL.

Version 1.2: fmtcount now loads xspace package, and uses \xspace
after \numberstring etc.

Version 1.1: Added German support. Added check for USenglish
and UKenglish babel settings.

Version 1.09: Added upper case variants \ORDINALstring etc 
(\MakeUppercase{\ordinalstring{<counter>}} doesn't work because
of the way \MakeUppercase expands its argument).

Added commands to store textual representations \storeordinalstring etc

Version 1.08: fixed Portugues spelling mistakes (tr\`es -> tr\^es
centa -> cento)

Version 1.07: fixed bug that causes fc-english.def to be loaded twice

Version 1.06: fixed language-related bug

Version 1.05: fixed bug in \padzeroes

Version 1.04: provided \FCordinal to avoid clashes with the memoir class.
