Files         : fmtcount.dtx   - documented source file
                fmtcount.ins   - installation script
		fmtcount.perl  - latex2html style file
		fc-samp.tex    - sample files
		fc-lang.tex    /

The package fmtcount.sty provides commands 
that display the value of a LaTeX counter in a variety 
of formats (ordinal, text, hexadecimal, decimal, 
octal, binary etc).  This package was originally provided
with the datetime package, but is now distributed separately.

See the documentation for more details.

To extract the code from the documented source file do:

latex fmtcount.ins

This will create the files: fmtcount.sty (the LaTeX package), 
and fc-*.def (the language definition files used by 
fmtcount.sty).

Move the .sty and .def files to somewhere LaTeX will find it 
(e.g. texmf/tex/latex/fmtcount/) and remember to update the TeX 
database. 

Copy the fmtcount.perl file to somewhere where LaTeX2HTML will 
find it (e.g. latex2html/styles/).

To extract the documentation do:

latex fmtcount.dtx
makeindex -s gglo.ist -t fmtcount.glg -o fmtcount.gls fmtcount.glo
latex fmtcount.dtx
latex fmtcount.dtx

Place the resulting file (fmtcount.dvi) into the documentation
directory (e.g. texmf/doc/latex/fmtcount/).
